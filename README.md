# Simple-CUDA
Create a CUDA program that will: <br />
1. initialize the array to zero <br />
2. change the array size and initialize it to zero <br />
3. create a kernel to add i to array[i] <br />
4. change the array size and see if 3 still works <br />
Note: the code currently prints out the answer to problem 4. To print the other problems, uncomment and comment the necessary code. <br />
To run in terminal: <br />
nvcc [filename] <br />
./a.out <br />
